##The step-by-step of RESTAPI deployment with NGINX and MONGODB
###Let's run the container
After creating the image and making sure it starts both mongod and nginx daemons
we create a container with `seris/docker` image

`docker run -d -P --name db seris/docker`

We want to make sure everything is running
###nginx
First let's look at the port assigned to 80 in the docker engine
`docker port db`
27017/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32777
28017/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32776
443/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32778
80/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32779
And the ip address of the Engine
`docker-machine ip default`
192.168.99.100

On the browser: **http://192.168.99.100:32779**
We should be getting NGINX welcome page

###Mongo
We will try to connect to the `mongod`from the client (on OSX)
`mongo --port 32777 --host 192.168.99.100`
